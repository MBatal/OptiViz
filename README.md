# OptiViz

**OptiViz** is a visual sandbox for optimization algorithms like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). Itâ€™s designed to make algorithm behavior more intuitive by showing how particles or agents evolve over time in 2D and 3D problem spaces.

## Features

- Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
- Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) (WIP)
- 2D and 3D visualizations using Matplotlib
- Modular structure for easy extensions
- Optional animation of optimization steps

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OptiViz.git
   cd OptiViz
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate       # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run a test script:
   ```bash
   python -m testing.animate_test
   ```
