# OptiViz - Optimization Algorithm Visualizer

OptiViz is a Python-based project aimed at visualizing optimization algorithms, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). The primary goal of this project is to create an interactive and visually appealing environment to observe the behavior of different optimization algorithms in various problem spaces.

## Overview

This project focuses on the implementation and visualization of optimization algorithms. Currently, the project includes basic implementations of PSO and ACO algorithms, with plans to extend to other algorithms in the future. The visualizer uses tools such as Plotly to represent particle movements and algorithm behavior in 2D, 3D, and potentially higher-dimensional spaces.

### Current Algorithms:

- **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**
- **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**

## Current Features

- Basic implementation of PSO for optimization of mathematical functions.
- Visualization of the algorithm behavior in 2D and 3D spaces.
- Interactive plotting using Plotly.
- Modular structure for easy addition of new algorithms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you'll need Python 3.7+ and some necessary dependencies. Here's how to get set up:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OptiViz.git
    cd OptiViz
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
    venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the main script to test the algorithms:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
